Here's a reference of the hotkeys you can use with the MiSTer. Hotkeys are useful at saving time and there are some hotkeys which do things you can only do with a keyboard or gamepad. Some of these hotkeys only work in the Main Menu core, others will work inside emulators as part of the gameplay, and some will work in all instances.

## In any core, with OSD closed

| Hotkey                                    | Description                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ++f12++                                   | Open the Menu/On-Screen Display                                                    |

## Core-specific hotkeys

### Some computer cores

Some computer cores make use of the Windows key (++win++) on your keyboard.

| Hotkey      | Description  |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| ++win+f12++ | Open the OSD |

### Light gun cores

Some consoles cores make use of USB/BT light guns, such as the Guncon2, Guncon3, Gun4IR, Sinden, etc.

[More calibration info here.](https://github.com/NolanNicholson/GunCon2-MiSTer?tab=readme-ov-file#calibration-instructions){target=_blank}

| Hotkey             | Description                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| OSD Open + ++f10++ | Enters light gun calibration. For best results, use a white/bright image |

### Cores that support savestates

Very few cores support savestates (NES, PSX, GameBoy, GBA, WonderSwan, AtariLynx). There are 4 savestate slots available. In those cores there is a standard savestate button you can assign on your controller (we'll call that SaveStateBtn here):

| Hotkey                                  | Description                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ++alt+f1++ - ++f4++                     | Save the state in slots 1-4 respectively      | 
| ++f1++ - ++f4++                         | Restore the state from slots 1-4 respectively |
| Controller: SaveStateBtn + Left/Right   | Switches the savestate slot                   |
| Controller: SaveStateBtn + Start + Down | Saves to the selected slot                    |
| Controller: SaveStateBtn + Start + Up   | Restores from the selected slot               |
